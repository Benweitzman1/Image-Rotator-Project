# Image Rotator

Image Rotator is a simple web application that allows users to upload images and rotate them by a specified angle to the left or right. The application uses the OpenCV library for image rotation and provides a user-friendly interface for image selection and rotation.

## Usage

1. Open the `Image_Rotator.html` file in your web browser.
2. Click on the "Add Image" button to select an image from your local file system.
3. Once an image is selected, it will be displayed on the canvas.
4. Use the "Left" and "Right" buttons to rotate the displayed image by the specified angle.
5. Enter a custom angle in the "Angle" input field (default is 45 degrees) to set the rotation angle.
6. The rotated image will be displayed on the canvas, and the rotation will be applied to the last selected image.

## Files

- `Image_Rotator.html`: The main HTML file containing the user interface and canvas for displaying images.
- `Image_Rotator.js`: The JavaScript file with the logic for handling image selection, rotation, and canvas rendering.
